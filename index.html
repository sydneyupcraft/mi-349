            <p>During the cold and rainy season, or during the spooky time of Halloween, this recipe is sure to warm you up! While boxed pumpkin bread can be very alluring, and seem to be easier, the spices mixed in this homemade pumpkin bread make for a taste you can't beat and it requires very little work. Simply combine and mix! No extra work is required for this dish. It also requires no yeast for rising, which makes it all the much easier to just combine and throw into the oven. This can make for a great snack, a side, a warm pairing with some hot chocolate or coffee, or even a course at your next Thanksgiving! This recipe can also convert into pumpkin muffins, or even changed to add some chocolate chips in this mix. Yum! I highly recommend adding a dollop of butter to a nice, warm slice to get the true moistness out of the bread.</p>

            <p>Packed with vegetables and protein, this sloppy joe recipe takes a twist on an American favorite. A comforting warm meal that can be made at any time of the year. This is especially a great recipe for those parents whose kids refuse to eat their vegetables.

These sloppy joes can be served on a bun, potatoes, or on its own! They can be topped with whatever toppings you enjoy, like pickles or grated cheddar cheese. As a side dish, some sweet potato tator tots or fries go great with the spices and flavors in this dish without having an unhealthy side.</p>
